This is an Assignment challenge where I have created Backend and Frontend for a Store Management system where the is ADMIN, NORMAL_USER, STORE_OWNER.
The Admin can Create, Update New User and new Store Listings.
The Normal User can give ratings and the Store Owner can See the ratings of there store.

It also supports secure user authentication and I have used Postgress for Databse and Prisma for ORM
